## Executive Summary

This review examines the FastAPI backend implementation for the Juno project. Overall, the structure shows promise but needs significant improvements in several key areas.

## Architecture Overview

The backend follows a basic FastAPI structure with:
- Main application entry point
- API routing organization
- Service layer separation
- Configuration management

## Positive Aspects

- Clean separation of concerns with services
- Proper use of FastAPI conventions
- Good project structure foundation

## Areas for Improvement

### 1. Error Handling
- Need comprehensive error handling middleware
- Missing custom exception classes
- No standardized error response format

### 2. Database Layer
- No database integration visible
- Missing data persistence layer
- No ORM or database abstraction

### 3. Authentication & Security
- No authentication implementation
- Missing CORS configuration
- No rate limiting or security headers

## Recommendations

1. Implement proper database layer with SQLAlchemy
2. Add comprehensive error handling
3. Include authentication and authorization
4. Add proper logging and monitoring
5. Implement API versioning strategy

## Conclusion

The backend has a solid foundation but needs significant development to be production-ready.

**Rating: 6/10** - Good start, needs substantial improvements
